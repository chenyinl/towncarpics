Web Services Photo Album
===========
See a live demo [here](http://chenyinl.github.com/towncarpics/).

A simple demo of using web service as data source instead of a web server.

This demo uses parse.com to store photos and Javascript to load from it.

The page server does not have to host the images. When add new images, the admin
can just add on the parse.com and this JS will generate the menu.
